Who doesn't remember **iTunes**? I miss it. I always used it to listen to music when Spotify wasn't so popular. But *why not merge **iTunes** with **Spotify** and **YouTube***, and give it my personal touch? The result was this: **SharkWave**.

It's still in development, it doesn't even have Spotify or YouTube built in, but you can try its local music player.
## How to play music locally?
Simple, just make sure you have a folder called `SharkWave` and it is organized like this:
```
~/SharkWave/
└── Artist/
    └── Album/
        ├── song1.mp3
        ├── song2.wav
        └── song3.flac
```
Make sure the music is in **MP3**, **Flac** or **Wav** format.
